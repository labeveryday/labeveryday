Welcome! My name is Du'An Lightfoot. I'm a [Developer Advocate](https://blogs.cisco.com/author/duanlightfoot) at Cisco DevNet. Lately I've grown to love everything code. Coming from a network engineering background I've faced many challenges on my software development journey. GitHub is a place where I decided to share my network automation experiences with the world!

## Here are some things about me:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on learning the latest in Network Automation
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Developing Applications using Cisco Core Platforms and APIs v1.0
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with understanding the complexities of computer science
- 💬 Ask me about anything Cisco DevNet and Network Automation
- 📫 How to reach me: [@labeveryday](www.twitter.com/labeveryday)
- ⚡ Fun fact: My favorite coding language is Python 🐍, I love nice watches ⌚️, and good food!
