Welcome! My name is Du'An Lightfoot. I'm a [Sr. Developer Advocate](https://blogs.cisco.com/author/duanlightfoot) at AWS. Lately I've grown to love everything about Cloud Networking. Coming from a network engineering background I've faced many challenges on my software development journey. GitHub is a place where I decided to share my cloud and network automation experiences with the world!

## Here are some things about me:

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on learning Cloud Networking
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning about Developing Applications using AWS
- ü§î I‚Äôm looking for help with understanding the complexities of computer science
- üí¨ Ask me about anything AWS networking
- üì´ How to reach me: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/labeveryday)
- ‚ö° Fun fact: My favorite coding language is Python üêç, I love nice watches ‚åöÔ∏è, and good food!
